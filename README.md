### Cypress Automation Setup Guide   
This project demonstrates the cypress + Javascript framework project setup.

### Features
* Time Travel - Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Simply hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
* Real time reloads - Cypress automatically reloads whenever you make changes to your tests. See commands execute in real time in your app.
* Spies, stubs, and clocks - Verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers.
* Consistent results - architecture doesnâ€™t use Selenium or WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free
* Debuggability - Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Chrome DevTools. Cypress readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.
* Automatic Waiting - Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.
* Screenshots and videos - View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos of your entire test suite when run headlessly.
